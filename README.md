# iOS_API_Memory_helper

## Why should the developer remember API? 
We are using many API every day.
Normaly, when the developer wanna implement some feature on the iOS device, he needed to check if the feature can be supported by the iOS API, such as UIKit, from the document.
If we memory the API, we can estimate, implement and debug the feature in a very effective way.

## How can we remember API more effectively?
I tried to remember some APIs in many times. And I failed.
Because remembering these can be very borning. And it is easy for me to feel frustrating when I need to review the same API again and again.
Intrestingly, I learn a way from a Japanese series, which can help me remeber thing in a very effective way.
The name of the way is "Memory Tree", in which you should organize the things you wanna keep in mind in a associate way.
These PDF use this way to organize the API. And I belive these document can help developer remeber API more effectively, which can greatly help to increase the developing speed.

## What should do next?
I will add more and more API document in these way in the future. If you wanna help me, just fork it, submmit the pull request.
